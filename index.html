          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Kyle's awesome website.  This is mostly intended for friends and family to discover what I've been up to: projects, interests, and of course random, disparate thoughts.  I use the word 'discover' because I'm not actually going to tell anyone about this site.  I've started an AdWords campaign using all of my friends' and family members' names as keywords.  If you came here, then I succeeded in getting your attention. You're as narcissistic as me!  Pwn it up!</p>

          <p>Also, this website is best viewed in Chrome.  It's unfortunately the only browser that supports all the HTML5 features that I want on my site.</p>

          <div class="entry">Wow, talk about a hiatus! Time to get back in the saddle and start taking care of this website. I've removed the pictures section because, let's face it, I don't take a lot of pictures. I've also updated the state of some of my projects (beer = finished; table = still unfinished). And I have some new ones I'm working on, so hopefully that'll give me some more interesting things to talk about.</div>

              I decided to start exploring the world of mobile development. Since I have an android phone (and know how to code in java), an android application seemed like the best place to get started. My next couple blog entries, starting with this one, will detail the steps needed to get an idea onto your phone.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>First, I settled on an easy-to-get-off-the-ground java application: a deck of cards. It's really easy to write and test, and it should be easy for me to add in the libraries necessary to port it to my phone.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Here's the code that I wrote:</p>
            <code>
              public enum Suit {
                CLUBS,
                DIAMONDS,
                HEARTS,
                SPADES,
              }

              public enum Rank {
                TWO,
                THREE,
                ...
                KING,
                ACE,
              }

              public class Card {
                private final Suit suit;
                private final Rank rank;

                public Card(Suit suit, Rank rank) {
                  this.suit = suit;
                  this.rank = rank;
                }

                @Override
                public String toString() {
                  return rank.toString() + suit.toString();
                }
              }

              public class Deck {
                private final List<Card> cards;
                private final Random rng;

                public Deck() {
                  this.rng = new Random();
                  cards = new ArrayList<Card>();
                  for (Suit suit : Suit.values()) {
                    for (Rank rank : Rank.values()) {
                      cards.add(new Card(suit, rank));
                    }
                  }
                }
	
                public Card getCard() {
                  int pos = rng.nextInt(cards.size());
                  return cards.remove(pos);
                }
	
                public boolean hasCards() {
                  return !cards.isEmpty();
                }
	
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                  Deck deck = new Deck();
                  while (deck.hasCards()) {
                    Card card = deck.getCard();
                    System.out.println(card);
                  }
                }
              }
            </code>

              Alright, so it's been another super long hiatus. Will this be the last? Almost certainly not, but oh well. I'm going to try to make a much more concerted effort on all blog-related fronts: clean up the website and make it nifty; add more content so it's actually worth reading; and try to post/update the site more than once a week.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              First, let's address the clean up work. I've added pwnitup to my github account. Anyone can in theory check it out and update it, although I find that to be extremely unlikely. Instead, it's just been an excuse to practice my git skills. I've forked the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a> codebase, and will hopefully leverage that to make this site cleaner and more engaging.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              Once the website is cleaner and better organized, that will hopefully encourage me to produce more content more often. Just off the top of my head, I can picture posts in the future detailing my thoughts on the Cubs' rebuilding process, Stanford football's teardown process, programming from an outsider's perspective, brewing beer, etc.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              Stay tuned...

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My roommate and I came across an old coffee table at a garage sale a while back.  It was stained a light yellowish color, but suffered from some large water marks.  We bought it for $20 with the intention of fixing it up.  We detached the top from the base and treated it with a rich, dark, resin-colored wood stain and a triple-coat of polyethylene finish.  A few years later (ugh, I know), I finally decided to put an end to this project by buying a bunch of pipe fittings and building legs. It turned out a lot like the table shown in <a href="http://www.marybicycles.com/diy-scavenged-butcher-block-tabletop-on-cast-iron-pipe-base/">this blog</a>. I ended up using galvanized pipes instead of black ones (too much sticky gunk on the black ones), but otherwise was just as easy as advertised. I'm really happy with how it turned out.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My rocking chair was a pretty small project.  I found it next to a dumpster a year ago outside of my residence hall.  It was fairly rickety, and needed to be cleaned and stained.  Fortunately for me, all I had to do was tighten the screws and put on a light coat.  It's a pretty comfy chair, and is the central part of my reading nook.

          <div class="beer">Irish Stout</div>
          <p>
            For my third brew, I decided to try making an "Irish Stout." Like my previous two, this batch is from an ingredient kit that I purchased on Amazon from a company called "The Home Brewery." I was quite pleased with how "Wheat Beer" and "German Oktoberfest" turned out, so I have high hopes for this one as well. Given that it's all in one kit, it's pretty much just following directions. That being said, I felt like I was much more in tune with what was going on at each step of the process and what to look out for along the way. I think after one or two more of these easy brews, I'll move up to more complicated ones. (I'd really love to give <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/09/01/ale-chief-white-house-beer-recipe">Obama's White House beer</a> a try once I get a secondary fermenter).
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Things of note that were different from my previous brews:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Specialty grain steepage step had specific temperature requirements. I decided that while I was out at Safeway getting 5 gallons of distilled water (super cheap and convenient for both sterilization and measurement), that I would get a thermometer. I was very glad I did, as it was clear that different colors were going into the wort as the temperature got hotter. At around ~150F, very aromatic smoke/steam started coming off the pot too. Given the harsh warnings about going over 170F, I'm glad I was able to get the most out of the grains without adding bad tastes to the beer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This beer had more ingredients than my previous two brews. I was adding things to the wort pre-boil, 45 minutes in, 50 minutes in, and 58 minutes in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The instructions of this beer indicated that I should bring the temperature of the wort down to room temperature as soon as possible. I did a pseudo ice-bath in my sink, but otherwise didn't know what technique I was supposed to use. I guess if the beer turns out bad I should investigate alternative options to properly chill the wort.
              </ul>
          </p>
          </br>
          <p>
            Hopefully I followed directions ok, didn't introduce bacteria, and didn't kill the yeast. This one should be ready right as the first pitches of the new wild-card games are thrown in early October. Cheers!
