          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Kyle's awesome website.  This is mostly intended for friends and family to discover what I've been up to: projects, interests, and of course random, disparate thoughts.  I use the word 'discover' because I'm not actually going to tell anyone about this site.  I've started an AdWords campaign using all of my friends' and family members' names as keywords.  If you came here, then I succeeded in getting your attention. You're as narcissistic as me!  Pwn it up!</p>
          <br/>
          <p>Also, this website is best viewed in Chrome.  It's unfortunately the only browser that supports all the HTML5 features that I want on my site.</p>

          <div class="entry">Well, here's my first entry.  This site is going to be pretty rudimentary at first, but as things ramp up, I'll start adding more features (and content worth reading).  Sorry for such a lame first post.</div>

          <div class="entry">Wow, talk about a hiatus! Time to get back in the saddle and start taking care of this website. I've removed the pictures section because, let's face it, I don't take a lot of pictures. I've also updated the state of some of my projects (beer = finished; table = still unfinished). And I have some new ones I'm working on, so hopefully that'll give me some more interesting things to talk about.</div>

          <div class="entry">I decided to start exploring the world of mobile development. Since I have an android phone (and know how to code in java), an android application seemed like the best place to get started. My next couple blog entries, starting with this one, will detail the steps needed to get an idea onto your phone.
            <br/>
            <p>First, I settled on an easy-to-get-off-the-ground java application: a deck of cards. It's really easy to write and test, and it should be easy for me to add in the libraries necessary to port it to my phone.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Here's the code that I wrote:</p>
            <code>
              public enum Suit {
                CLUBS,
                DIAMONDS,
                HEARTS,
                SPADES,
              }

              public enum Rank {
                TWO,
                THREE,
                ...
                KING,
                ACE,
              }

              public class Card {
                private final Suit suit;
                private final Rank rank;

                public Card(Suit suit, Rank rank) {
                  this.suit = suit;
                  this.rank = rank;
                }

                @Override
                public String toString() {
                  return rank.toString() + suit.toString();
                }
              }

              public class Deck {
                private final List<Card> cards;
                private final Random rng;

                public Deck() {
                  this.rng = new Random();
                  cards = new ArrayList<Card>();
                  for (Suit suit : Suit.values()) {
                    for (Rank rank : Rank.values()) {
                      cards.add(new Card(suit, rank));
                    }
                  }
                }
	
                public Card getCard() {
                  int pos = rng.nextInt(cards.size());
                  return cards.remove(pos);
                }
	
                public boolean hasCards() {
                  return !cards.isEmpty();
                }
	
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                  Deck deck = new Deck();
                  while (deck.hasCards()) {
                    Card card = deck.getCard();
                    System.out.println(card);
                  }
                }
              }
            </code>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My roommate and I came across an old coffee table at a garage sale a while back.  It was stained a light yellowish color, but suffered from some large water marks.  We bought it for $20 with the intention of fixing it up.  We detached the top from the base and treated it with a rich, dark, resin-colored wood stain and a triple-coat of polyethylene finish.  A few years later (ugh, I know), I finally decided to put an end to this project by buying a bunch of pipe fittings and building legs. It turned out a lot like the table shown in <a href="http://www.marybicycles.com/diy-scavenged-butcher-block-tabletop-on-cast-iron-pipe-base/">this blog</a>. I ended up using galvanized pipes instead of black ones (too much sticky gunk on the black ones), but otherwise was just as easy as advertised. I'm really happy with how it turned out.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My rocking chair was a pretty small project.  I found it next to a dumpster a year ago outside of my residence hall.  It was fairly rickety, and needed to be cleaned and stained.  Fortunately for me, all I had to do was tighten the screws and put on a light coat.  It's a pretty comfy chair, and is the central part of my reading nook.
